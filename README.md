# TecMagDiSys-ver-1.0
TecMagDiSys: A new computer program for multidimensional tectonomagmatic discrimination.

The complete source code of TecMagDiSys (version 1.0) project is available for downloading from the following public repository (https://github.com/ldiazgon80za/TecMagDiSys-ver-1.0), 
together with a README file, the open-source code license (MIT), and templates or input files. 

TecMagDiSys (Tectono-Magmatic Discrimination System) is a new online software meant for deciphering a total of 29 igneous rock tectonic settings through two new comprehensive multidimensional 
discrimination models based on major elements (SiO2 to P2O5), and major and trace elements (SiO2 to P2O5, Cr, Nb, Ni, V, Y, and Zr), that were recently published by Verma (2020a). 

TecMagDiSys is structured in three modules: 
	1. tectono-magmatic discrimination applies 56 discriminant functions and estimates the probabilities for all classes; 
	2. uncertainty propagation simulates independent analyses from the Monte Carlo procedure in terms of the mean composition and related analytical errors of any given individual analysis or an average composition; 
	3. post-emplacement changes module simulates new compositions from post-emplacement alteration-related changes (gain or loss of single or multiple elements) of any given sample. 

TecMagDiSys provides an extended report (with the adjusted data, log-transformed variables, discriminant functions results, and probability values) for individual samples; 
and a summary report of post-processing including the inference about the most probable tectonic setting in each sample set. TecMagDiSys software is recommended in any future applications for probability-based inferences on tectonic settings. TecMagDiSys is freely available for use at the web portal http://tlaloc.ier.unam.mx/tecmagdisys.
